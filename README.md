APK Fission
-----------

This repository consists of `APKBUILD` files for software packaged by the [APK Fission](https://apkfission.net) project directly. The following structure obtains:

* `README.md` (this file)
* `main/` (free, open-source/libre software)
* `nonfree/` (free software with restrictive licenses)

Per APK Fission policy, only software which is rejected from the [Adelie](http://adelielinux.org) Linux distribution for licensing reasons only are considered for inclusion in `nonfree`. Other software which is not yet packaged, or which may require special considerations (e.g. 'all-in-one' packages as described on APK Fission's [policy page](https://apkfission.net/policy.html)), may be found in `main`.

Neither repository shall conflict with Ad&eacute;lie's `user` repository.
